A transparent web browser to enable Design and Dev to compare build with design

## Challenge

Currently we are using the 2.56 ratio for Design to Work with Development build.
There is a lot of discrepancy with this approach as it is sometimes tricky to compare the small changes between devices and the actual design.

## Solution

Besides being consistent with Design in our sizing dimesnions. This small web-browser aims to allow design to compare the build with the final design but changing the opacity of the small web browser - (built with electron).

There are some issues and challenges to fix too !


## FE Challenge

• Can you connect the url in the controls above to the website - you should continue with Vanilla JS to be able to update the window.location or think of something cooler !


## FE Stretch Goals

• This browser is draggable but can you allow the user to toggle between dragging over the design or being able to interact with the web-page ?

• Can you fix the zoom and dimension controls to allow for mobile switching controls ?


## BE Challenge

• Is there a way to save user preferences in local storage as a cookie ?
• How could we improve the performance of this browser or monitor user interactions? 

## QA Challenge

• How can we improve the user experince of this browser?
• Are there any improvements or edge cases that we could also consider for this ?

## Product Challenge 

• What kind of features could we explore or add to this browser to meet our competitors functionality and features ?
• What would be the mission and strategy for this browser and who else could this be targeted for ? 
• What other industries or demographics would benefit from a transparent browser ?

## Design Challenge

• How could we brand this to be a universal browser that is cross-language recognised for it's unique functionality
• How could the UI be rebranded to match this ? 
• What kind of color theory is appropriate for the industry and functionality of this browser ?
